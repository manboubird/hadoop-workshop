Apache Hadoop is a software framework that supports data-intensive distributed applications under a free license.[1] It enables applications to work with thousands of nodes and petabytes of data. Hadoop was inspired by Google's MapReduce and Google File System (GFS) papers.Hadoop is a top-level Apache project being built and used by a global community of contributors,[2] using the Java programming language. Yahoo! has been the largest contributor[3] to the project, and uses Hadoop extensively across its businesses.[4]Hadoop was created by Doug Cutting,[5] who named it after his son's toy elephant.[6] It was originally developed to support distribution for the Nutch search engine project.[7]
