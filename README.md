To make executable jar and shells, you can do:  

`mvn package`

  or

`mvn -P pseudo package`

First one is for standalone mode, second is for pseudo-distributed mode.

### Executing ###

To execute WordCount job with hadoop command, you can do:

`hadoop jar target/hadoop-workshop-0.0.1.jar com.knownstylenolife.hadoop.workshop.wordcount.tool.WordCountSimpleToolMain input output`

To execute WordCount job with shell, you can do:

`sh target/appassembler/bin/wordcount input output`

This shell script is generated by [Appassembler Maven Plug-In](http://mojo.codehaus.org/appassembler/appassembler-maven-plugin/).
